Automated hotel payment email confirmation using Google Forms, Sheets &amp; Apps Script.

üì¨ Google Form Email Automation for Hotel Payment Confirmation

üß† Project Overview
I built an automation system using Google Forms, Google Sheets, and Google Apps Script that automatically sends a confirmation email to the hotel owner whenever a customer submits a payment form.

üìå Problem
The hotel‚Äôs manual workflow for tracking guest payments was time-consuming and prone to delays. Staff had to:

‚Ä¢ Constantly monitor form responses in Google Sheets
‚Ä¢ Manually draft and send payment confirmation emails
‚Ä¢ Risk missing entries or sending late responses, which could affect customer satisfaction and internal coordination

üöÄ Solution
Using Google Apps Script, I automated the process to:
‚Ä¢ Read form responses instantly
‚Ä¢ Format the message
‚Ä¢ Send an email with all details to the hotel owner automatically

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
‚Ä¢ Google Forms
‚Ä¢ Google Sheets
‚Ä¢ Google Apps Script (JavaScript-based)
‚Ä¢ MailApp Service (built-in Google service)

üíª Code
// Function that sends an email when form is submitted
function sendEmail(e) {
  var name = e.values[1];
  var contact = e.values[2];
  var room = e.values[3];
  var checkin = e.values[4];
  var checkout = e.values[5];
  var amount = e.values[6];
  var paymentMethod = e.values[7];

  var message = "New hotel payment confirmed:\n\n" +
                "Name: " + name + "\n" +
                "Contact number: " + contact + "\n" +
                "Room number: " + room + "\n" +
                "Check-in date: " + checkin + "\n" +
                "Check-out date: " + checkout + "\n" +
                "Amount: " + amount + "\n" +
                "Payment Method: " + paymentMethod;

  MailApp.sendEmail("alvinzipagan09@gmail.com", "New Payment Confirmation", message);
}

// Trigger setup (run this once)
function setupTrigger() {
  var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActive();
  ScriptApp.newTrigger("sendEmail")
    .forSpreadsheet(ss)
    .onFormSubmit()
    .create();
}

üí¨ Talking Point

One of the projects I completed involved automating the confirmation system for hotel payments using Google Forms and Apps Script. It helped streamline operations by sending structured emails to the admin every time a customer submitted payment info. I used JavaScript in Google Apps Script to access the form data, format a message, and send an email in real-time.
